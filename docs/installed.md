# Speechy: Thank you for installation/update!
[See changes from the previous version!](https://github.com/hmirin/speechy/releases)

## Setup

1. You need to get your API key for the API provider you choose. Currently, Speechy supports only this API.
    - [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/)
        - Description: This API provides WaveNet (Deep Learning based high quality voice synthesis algorithm) voice. Highly recommended!
        - Follow the instruction on [this link](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158862) to get your API key.
            - We recommend you to restrict the API key only to Cloud Text-to-speech API for security.

2. Click this extension's icon on the address bar and choose API and add API key and push save.
